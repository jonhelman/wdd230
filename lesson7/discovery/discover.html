<p>
	The City of Bacoor is a first-class component city in Cavite and it's the second largest city in the Province, with the first being Dasmi침as.
	It is located at the gateway to Metro Manila. A sub-urban area, the city is located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Imus and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) southwest of Manila, on the southeastern shore of Manila Bay, at the northwest portion of the province with an area of 52.4 square kilometers. 
	It is bordered to the east by Las Pi침as and Muntinlupa, to the south by Dasmari침as, to the west by Kawit and Imus, and to the north by Bacoor Bay an inlet of Manila Bay. Bacoor is separated from Las Pi침as by the Zapote River and from Imus and Kawit by Bacoor River.
	Most of the city is composed of flat, formerly agricultural lands, with some areas such as the coastal districts of Zapote, Talaba, Niog, and Panapaan lying below sea level. Some districts such as Molino and Queens Row are situated on the hills that form valleys along the upstream portion of Zapote River.
</p>

<p>
	Bacoor is currently experiencing a rapid shift from an agriculture-based economy to a residential/commercial urban center. Nowadays, retail, manufacturing, banking and service sectors are Bacoor's primary income earners. 
	Commercial activities are sporadic throughout the city ranging from wholesale to retail establishments, restaurants and eateries, hardware and construction supplies and other service-related industries, especially those located in SM City Bacoor where it serves as the city's main income earner. 
	The mostly residential area of Molino is also home to SM Center Molino at the corner of Molino Road and Daang Hari. The entrance area from the Coastal Road to Aguinaldo Highway in Talaba and the area surrounding the Zapote Public Market (now the Bacoor Public Market) are other commercial centers. 
	Bacoor has branches of 11 different commercial banks all over the city.

	Meanwhile, agricultural area has lessened to only 100 hectares while fishponds which likewise decreased to almost half of the original 760 hectares. 
	Salt production, fishing, oyster and mussel culture, which are now being threatened to near extinction because of pollution and overpopulation, are the other sources of income of the residents. 
	These industries are also threatened by the construction of the Cavite Coastal Road Extension which directly affected the Bacoor shoreline.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Some accounts indicate that the city of Bacoor, also named Bakood or Bakoor was founded as a pueblo or town in 1671. 
	When Spanish troops first arrived in Bacoor they met some local inhabitants in the process of building a bamboo fence (bakod in Filipino) around a house. 
	The Spaniards asked the men the name of the village but because of the difficulties in understanding each other, the local inhabitants thought the Spaniards were asking what they were building. 
	The men answered "bakood". The Spaniards pronounced it as "bacoor" which soon became the town's name.</p>

<p>During the 1990s and 2000s, Bacoor attempted to achieve cityhood status due to its growing population and tax income, with several cityhood bills filed in Congress in 1997, 2000 and 2007. 
	On July 25, 2011, President Benigno Simeon Aquino III signed into law Republic Act No. 10160 creating the City of Bacoor. 
	It was ratified through a plebiscite on June 23, 2012, wherein 36,226 of the town's 40,080 registered voters voted in favor of cityhood while those against were 3,854.
	With the incorporation of Bacoor as a city, it was divided into two legislative districts, Bacoor West and Bacoor East. 
	During the 2013 mid-term elections, the citizens of Bacoor voted for six councilors for each districts forming a 12-person city council.
</p>

	<h2>Demographics</h2>

	<p>In the 2020 census, the population of Bacoor, was 664,625 people, with a density of 14,000 inhabitants per square kilometre or 36,000 inhabitants per square mile. It is the second most populous city in the province after Dasmari침as.
		The city is a bedroom community of Metro Manila which owes its large population to the influx of low and middle-income settlers who availed of the various housing projects and subdivisions in it.
